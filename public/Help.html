                    <b>Q1: Im having connection issues, what should I do?</b>
                    <p>If you're experiencing connection issues or encountering errors while trying to join the server, 
                        please check your internet connection, Minecraft version compatibility, and server status. 
                        If the problem persists, feel free to contact our support team for assistance.</p>    
                    <b>Q2: What is a server IP address?</b>
                    <p>The server IP address is a numerical label assigned to each Minecraft server. It serves as the 
                        unique identifier for the server on the internet, allowing players to connect to the 
                        server using its IP address.</p>   
                    <b>Q3: What kind of information can I find on this site?</b>
                    <p>We offer a variety of broader MineCraft information and primarily focus on updating on 
                        various MineCraft servers and their status.

                    <b>Q4: Wny does a server claim to be active but is actually offline</b>
                    <p>There are many possible reasons, try to refresh the page as old data could be loaded
                        on your webpage. Other reasons could include errors in the code on our end, issues with 
                        the server owner's connection or a bad user connection. Always make sure to be connected to 
                        the internet when checking and refreshing our site.
                    </p>   
                    <b>Q5: Why is there outdated information on the website?</b>
